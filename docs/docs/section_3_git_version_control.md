# üîß SECTION 3: Git & Version Control

> A professional-grade, scalable Git workflow and version control strategy tailored to agency projects ranging from small websites to enterprise apps.

---

## üéØ Purpose
To standardize how developers collaborate, commit, review, and deploy using Git ‚Äî with clarity, accountability, and long-term maintainability.

---

## üöÄ Branching Strategy: Custom Flow

We use a **custom-named flow** instead of traditional `dev ‚Üí alpha ‚Üí prod`, which provides more clarity, value, and professionalism.

### üîÅ Main Flow:
```
workspace ‚Üí quality-gate ‚Üí launchpad
```

| Stage Name     | Purpose                                                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `workspace`     | Developer playground: all active development starts here             |
| `quality-gate`  | QA-tested, internally approved builds: pre-production validation    |
| `launchpad`     | Final, stable, production-ready code deployed to clients/users     |

---

## üå± Supporting Branch Types

| Branch Type | Format                  | Purpose                                                       |
|-------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature     | `feature/<name>`        | New features; merged into `workspace`                         |
| Fix         | `fix/<bug>`             | Bug fixes; merged into `workspace` or `quality-gate`          |
| Hotfix      | `hotfix/<issue>`        | Urgent production issues; merged directly into `launchpad`    |
| Experiment  | `lab/<experiment>`      | Spikes, PoCs, internal test ideas                              |

---

## üîÄ Merge Strategy

| From           | To              | Requirements                                         |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `feature/*`     | `workspace`       | Peer review preferred, auto-tests must pass          |
| `workspace`     | `quality-gate`    | Weekly merge cycle, QA checklist before merge        |
| `quality-gate`  | `launchpad`       | Final UAT or client approval, tagged release         |
| `hotfix/*`      | `launchpad`       | Mandatory reviewer, post-deploy patch                |

---

## üßæ Naming Guidelines

| Element           | Convention            | Example                          |
|------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Feature Branch    | `feature/<hyphen-name>`| `feature/invoice-discount`       |
| Bug Fix Branch    | `fix/<short-issue>`    | `fix/payment-timeout`            |
| Hotfix Branch     | `hotfix/<urgent-issue>`| `hotfix/token-expiry-crash`      |
| Spike Branch      | `lab/<experiment>`     | `lab/new-price-logic`            |

## üí¨ Commit Message Style: Conventional Commits

| Prefix     | Purpose                                      |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `feat:`     | New feature                                  |
| `fix:`      | Bug fix                                      |
| `chore:`    | Cleanup, tooling, configs                    |
| `docs:`     | Documentation updates                        |
| `refactor:` | Code restructure, no logic change            |
| `test:`     | Test-related commits                         |

**Examples:**
```bash
feat: add OTP validation to login
fix: correct rounding error in invoice total
chore: update Prettier config
```

|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `workspace`     | Open, reviewed merges preferred, CI on PRs            |
| `quality-gate`  | Protected: test results, checklist, 1 reviewer needed |
| `launchpad`     | Highly protected: only maintainers can merge          |

## üß™ QA & Review Policy

| Branch         | Reviewed by          | Testing Required     |

## üìÅ Essential Git Files in Every Repo

```
.gitignore           # Properly scoped per language/framework
.gitattributes       # Normalize EOL, enforce diff rules
README.md            # Clear setup and run instructions
CONTRIBUTING.md      # PR process, rules, commit guide
CHANGELOG.md         # Track release history
