## 🎯 Purpose

## 🧠 9.1 Code Review Philosophy

- Every line of code must be reviewed before merging
- Reviewers are responsible for quality, security, and design
- Submitters must respond to all comments and resolve issues
- Reviews are NOT just syntax checks — they should cover:
  - Business logic
  - Edge cases
  - Performance and security
  - Readability and naming
