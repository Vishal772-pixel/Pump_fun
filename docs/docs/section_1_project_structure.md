# 🧱 SECTION 1: Project Architecture & Structure

## 🎯 Purpose
Define how our codebase is structured, named, and scaled — ensuring consistency across all developers, for both small-scale websites and large enterprise apps.

This ensures:
- 🔍 Easy code discovery
- 🚀 Faster onboarding of new devs
- 🧱 Scalable systems from MVP to production
- ✅ Cleaner DevOps automation

## 🏗️ 1.1 Choosing an Architecture: Monolith vs Microservices

### 🔸 Monolithic Architecture

**Best For:**
- MVPs, admin panels, static or semi-dynamic websites
- Single-team projects

**Pros:**
- Easier to build, debug, and deploy
- Faster development lifecycle
- Shared memory (no inter-service communication needed)

**Cons:**
- Can become tightly coupled
- Hard to scale horizontally
- Updates might affect unrelated modules

**Example Structure:**
```
/backend
  /controllers
  /models
  /services
/frontend
  /components
  /pages
  /styles
```

---

### 🔸 Microservices Architecture

**Best For:**
- High-scale systems (SaaS platforms, eCommerce, AI systems)
- When multiple dev teams work independently
- Need for frequent independent deployments

**Pros:**
- Scalability, modularity, isolated failures
- Each service deployable independently
- Tech stack freedom per service

**Cons:**
- Higher DevOps complexity (Docker, k8s, service mesh)
- Requires communication protocols (REST, gRPC)
- Debugging across services is harder

**Example Structure:**
```
/services
  /auth-service
  /payment-service
  /notification-service
  /frontend-client
  /admin-dashboard
```

**📌 Agency Rule:**  
> Start with a clean **modular monolith**.  
> Migrate to microservices **only when:**
> - More than 3 distinct business domains,
> - More than 5 backend developers involved,
> - Need for isolated deployments becomes critical.

## 📁 1.2 Feature-Based Folder Structure (Frontend)

### Example: Next.js or React Project
```
/src
  /features
    /auth
      LoginPage.jsx
      authSlice.js
      authAPI.js
    /products
      ProductList.jsx
      productService.js
  /components         # Shared UI components
  /hooks              # Reusable custom logic
  /services           # Axios, Firebase, APIs
  /utils              # General-purpose functions
  /constants          # Static config and literals
  /assets             # Images, fonts, logos
  /styles             # Global SCSS, themes
```

- Use **barrel exports** (`index.js`) in folders for import simplicity.
- One folder = one feature = one team.

## 📱 1.3 Mobile App Folder Structure (Flutter Example)
```
/lib
  /screens
    /login
    /dashboard
  /components
  /services
  /models
  /constants
  /utils
/assets
  /images
  /icons
  /fonts
```

- Reuse widgets wherever possible.
- Keep business logic outside of screens.

---

## 🧠 1.4 Backend Folder Structure (Express / NestJS)

### Express Example:
```
/src
  /controllers
  /routes
  /models
  /services
  /middlewares
  /utils
  /config
```

### NestJS Modular Example:
```
/src
  /auth
    auth.module.ts
    auth.controller.ts
    auth.service.ts
    auth.entity.ts
  /orders
  /products
```

- Use `Module → Controller → Service → Entity` pattern
- Logic must not leak into controllers

## 🏷️ 1.5 Naming Conventions

| Element         | Convention      | Example                      |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Folders         | kebab-case       | `user-profile/`              |
| Files (JS/TS)   | kebab-case       | `auth-api.js`                |
| React Comp.     | PascalCase       | `UserProfileCard.jsx`        |
| Classes         | PascalCase       | `UserService`                |
| Variables       | camelCase        | `totalAmount`                |
| Constants       | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`         |

**❌ Avoid:**
- Single-letter variables (`x`, `res`, `y`)
- Lowercase acronyms (`urlhandler.js`)

## 🧽 1.6 Directory Hygiene & Maintenance

| Rule                              | Notes                                         |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| No file > 300 lines               | Break into smaller files                      |
| Deprecated → `_legacy/` folder   | Include archive date + reason in README       |
| `.env.example` is mandatory       | Shows all environment variables               |
| No circular imports               | Detect with `madge` CLI                       |
| Complex modules → `README.md`    | Explain logic, flow, and usage                |

**Extra Tips:**
- Remove dead code every sprint
- Keep folder depth ≤ 3 levels

## 🛠️ 1.7 Tooling for Structure Enforcement

- `eslint` – for linting rules and naming checks
- `prettier` – for consistent formatting
- `madge` – to detect circular dependencies
- `hygen` / `plop.js` – generate feature/component structure

---

## 📦 1.8 Lazy Loading & Code Splitting

**Frontend (React/Next):**
- Use `React.lazy`, `Suspense`
- Use `next/dynamic()` for Next.js

**Backend (Modular Services):**
- Separate heavy features into service modules
- Use dynamic imports where supported (Node >=14)

## 📑 1.9 Required Files in Project Root

```
README.md           # Project overview and how to run
CONTRIBUTING.md     # How to contribute, PR rules
CHANGELOG.md        # Version history and changes
.env.example        # All environment variables listed
CODEOWNERS          # Review responsibilities per folder
```
