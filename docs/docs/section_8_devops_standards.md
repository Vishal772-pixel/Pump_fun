# 🚀 SECTION 8: DevOps & Deployment Standards

> This section defines how software should be deployed, versioned, monitored, and rolled back — whether hosted on cloud services, containers, or managed platforms.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
To ensure that all apps:
- 🧪 Are reliably tested before release
- ♻️ Can be safely deployed and rolled back
- ⚙️ Have clear CI/CD processes
- 🔒 Are securely configured and observed in production

---

## 🛠️ 8.1 Environments

| Environment     | Purpose                             | Notes                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `local`         | Developer machine                    | `.env.local`, mock data       |
| `sandbox`       | Internal preview/staging             | CI-only auto-deploy           |
| `testbed`       | UAT or QA team use                   | Closely mirrors production    |
| `live`          | Final, customer-facing production    | Secured + monitored           |

---

## ⚙️ 8.2 CI/CD Pipelines

Use **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, **Bitbucket Pipelines**, or **Render/Vercel** deployments.

### Pipeline Stages:
1. **Install & Build**
2. **Lint & Prettier Check**
3. **Unit Tests + Integration Tests**
4. **Security Scan (e.g. snyk, dependabot)**
5. **Deploy (Preview/Test/Prod)**

> Each environment should have **its own pipeline config** and secret keys.

---

## 🐳 8.3 Containerization & Docker

- Every backend app must include:
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `.dockerignore`
  - Healthcheck in Docker or code (`/healthz`)
- Use `node:alpine` for smaller base image
- Multi-stage builds for faster CI
- Containers must expose only necessary ports

---

## 🌐 8.4 Hosting & Infrastructure

| Use Case          | Platform                      | Notes                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Static Websites   | Vercel, Netlify               | CI-linked deployments                 |
| Fullstack Apps    | Render, Railway, DigitalOcean | Can use Docker or direct git deploy   |
| Containerized API | AWS ECS, Heroku, Fly.io       | With buildpacks or Docker             |
| Database          | PlanetScale, Supabase, Mongo Atlas | Must support daily backups      |

---

## 🔁 8.5 Rollbacks & Recovery

| Situation        | Rollback Strategy                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Deployment Fail  | Use versioned tags or last known good build        |
| DB Migration Fail| Use down-scripts or snapshots                      |
| Bug in Production| Toggle feature flag or rollback entire build       |

- Always test rollbacks in staging.
- Maintain rollback scripts with migrations.

---

## 🔒 8.6 Secrets & Config Management

| Type       | Practice                                        |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Secrets    | Store in `.env` or secret manager (e.g., Doppler, AWS SM) |
| API Keys   | Must be different per environment               |
| Config Vars| Use centralized config files or `.env.*` files |

> Do not hardcode secrets. Never commit `.env` to version control.

---

## 📈 8.7 Monitoring & Alerts

| Layer       | Tools                       | Notes                           |
|-------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Uptime      | UptimeRobot, Pingdom        | 5-min heartbeat check            |
| Logs        | Logtail, Papertrail, Sentry | Log levels + error alerts        |
| Performance | New Relic, Grafana          | CPU, RAM, Response Time          |
| Incidents   | Slack Webhooks, PagerDuty   | Alert escalation configured      |

- Every critical failure must alert the dev channel
- Dashboards must be setup for each production app
